## Past Projects

### AI & Machine Learning

- **Financial-Analyst-AI** (Python): Automates retrieval and analysis of SEC EDGAR filings (10-K/10-Q). Generates plain-English summaries, extracts key financial metrics (revenue, EBITDA, cash flow), and produces PDF/HTML reports.
- **Deepfake-Face-Detector** (Python): Trained on Kaggle datasets with over 300,000 images, achieving ~99.7% accuracy in detecting deepfake faces.
- **Q-Learning-Grid-World-in-C** (C): Pure C implementation of a Q-learning agent for optimal pathfinding in a 2D grid with obstacles. Features epsilon-greedy exploration with decay, binary Q-table serialization, and CLI for training/playback.

### Web & Backend Systems

- **Video-Streaming-Platform** (Python): Client-server video streaming architecture with network protocol handling.
- **High-performance-URL-shortener** (Go): Production-grade URL shortener with async click analytics via buffered channels, read-through caching with sync.Map, Prometheus metrics, SQLite persistence, and Docker deployment.
- **Rust-crawler** (Rust): Concurrent async web crawler using Tokio/Reqwest. Features bounded concurrency, BFS traversal with max-depth, URL deduplication, same-origin restriction, per-host politeness delays, and JSON export.
- **orb** (TypeScript, CSS): Interactive web application deployed on Vercel via v0.app.
- **prompt-wars-v0** (TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS): Interactive prompt-based game built with Next.js.
- **roni-web** (TypeScript, CSS): Personal portfolio website.
- **Website** (JavaScript): Personal website project.
- **Landing-page** (HTML/CSS): Customizable landing page template.
- **Newsletter-API**: Financial newsletter aggregation service.

### Miscellaneous Stuff

- **GameTheory** (Python, Jupyter): Analysis of game theory, Markov chains, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, and linear regression applied to strategic decision-making.
- **Prisoners-Dilemma** (Python): Simulation of the Prisoner's Dilemma with configurable strategies, analyzing equilibria using linear algebra concepts.
- **java-capstone** (Java): Comprehensive data structures implementation - capstone project.
- **red-black-tree-search-sort** (Java): Self-balancing red-black tree with search and sort operations.
- **binary-search-tree** (Java): Binary search tree implementation with standard operations.
- **inversion-counter-java** (Java): Efficient algorithm for counting inversions in arrays.
- **Python-DS** (Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks): This repo is basically just a compilation of tons of data science projects I had to do for a class with a lot of homework assignments. Some of the key concepts included: Python/pandas/Jupyter for data manipulation; data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA; ML techniques like classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction; statistical thinking with probability, hypothesis testing, and model evaluation; data visualization techniques; applications in NLP and time series analysis.
- **C-Programming** (C): Notable mentions:
  - Built a networked database lookup server using shell scripts, named pipes, and netcat, then wrapped it in a C program that used fork()/exec() to manage multiple server instances and waitpid() with WNOHANG to track child process termination.
  - Built a socket-based database lookup server and an HTTP client in C, where the server wrapped file descriptors with fdopen() to handle client queries over TCP and the client sent HTTP/1.0 GET requests to download files from web servers.
  - Built an HTTP/1.0 web server in C that served static files from a directory and dynamically queried a database backend, using socket programming to handle browser requests and maintain a persistent connection to a lookup server.

### Other Projects

- **Mystery-Code** (Python, COBOL, Fortran, Prolog, Haskell, Erlang): Cryptographic puzzle challenge across 6 programming languages - solve it for a prize.
- **v0-voting-ui** (Python): Voting interface prototype.
